# Hi there! 👋

My name is Daniel!  I am a software engineer and an amateur **[ INSERT RANDOM HOBBY HERE ]**.

*I am currently a student at Lambda School*

I can have a conversation about anything and am obsessed with:
1. art&design 📐
2. nature 🌳
3. comedy :grinning:
4. travel :airplane:
5. fish tacos :taco: [^1]
[^1]: Battered baja-style fish tacos are the best kind, I don't care what anyone says.
